# Hackathon under Oslo Innovation Week 2015

Two-day hackathon during [Oslo Innovation Week](http://oiw.no), October 10-11 2015.
Participants from [Fellesverkstedet](http://fellesverkstedet) fablab, [Bitraf](http://bitraf.no) makerspace, and open drop-ins during event.

## 3d-print attachment for Motoman SK6 robot

* Using Arduino Uno with Teacup firmware
* QB Extruder

## Universal quickmount for workpiece registration

* Movable 'palett', where the workpiece can move between different machines.
* Easily adaptable to machines of different sizes
* Also possible to cast the required structure directly

* Other examples of machines interesting to use in workflow:
FDM 3d-printer (RepRap etc), silk-screen


* Tested with Shopbot CNC router, GCC laser-cutter and Motoman SK6 robot-arm.
And directly casting the geometry required for clamping action.
